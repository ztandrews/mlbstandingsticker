FEATURES:
- Simple, live updating MLB Ticker that cycles through the standings in each division and prints them out. 
- Each division is displayed for 10 seconds, then it goes to the next.
- Program will run until terminated
- Program is made to be displayed on a small monitor, either from a computer or a Raspberry Pi

FUTURE UPDATES AND GOALS
- Add league standings and wild card races
- Add live scoring (Need to find a public MLB Live Scores API)
- Add team logos
- Add buttons to cycle through standings

FUTURE BUG FIXES
- Need to stop the program from 'crashing' in between loops when root.update() is called


ABOUT THE PROJECT
Hello all! My name is Zach Andrews, a computer science student at Monmouth University.
This program was made to help me work with Python, API's, JSon data, and Tkinter.
I consider myself an 'eternal learner', and a way i do this  is by doing these small projects. 
While this project isn't too fancy or good looking, it is a big step in my dev career, as
I aspire to do things like this in the real world eventually.

The reason for this app, is so i can run it on my Raspberri Pi and keep it running on a small monitor at my desk. 
I want to eventually put live scoring updates, but I need to find a good, free MLB api first. Once I do, however,
I will be updating this to add it in.

Enjoy the progam, and feel free to reach out with any questions, comments, or suggestions!
